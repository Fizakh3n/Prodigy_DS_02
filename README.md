For Task 2, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand survival trends by focusing on cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing key features.<br>

What I Did <br>

Data Cleaning: I handled missing values in critical columns like Age, Fare, and Embarked, and decided to drop the Cabin column due to too many nulls. I also encoded categorical columns like Sex and Embarked for better analysis.<br>
Feature Engineering: I created a new feature called FamilySize by combining SibSp and Parch to examine how family size impacted survival.<br>
Visualizations: I used various visualizations to explore key trends:<br>
Analyzed survival rates based on gender, passenger class, age, family size, and embarkation point.<br>
Used a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between numeric features.<br>
Plotted scatter plots to study the interaction between Fare, Age, and Survived.<br>

What I Learned<br>

Survival Insights: I found that gender, class, and age played a significant role in determining survival, with females, first-class passengers, and younger children having better chances.<br>
Family Size Impact: I noticed that passengers with smaller family sizes had a higher survival rate.<br>
Data HandlingI enhanced my skills in handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and engineering new features to improve the analysis.<br>
VisualizationSkills: I gained valuable experience using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize relationships and trends in the dataset.<br>
